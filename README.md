## [Determining the solidness of borrowers via creditscoring](http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/service/datenarchiv/kredit/kredit_e.html)
In credit business, banks are interested in information whether prospective consumers will pay back their credit or not. The aim of credit-scoring is to model or predict the probability that a consumer with certain covariates is to be considered as a potential risk. The dataset consists of 1000 consumer credits from a german bank. For each consumer the binary response variable "creditability" is available. In addition, 20 covariates that are assumed to influence creditability were recorded.
